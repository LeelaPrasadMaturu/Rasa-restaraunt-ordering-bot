# Restaurant Ordering Bot (WIP)

> **Note:** This project is a **Work in Progress (WIP)** and is not fully functional. While the bot is operational, it currently has some errors and unimplemented features. Contributions and forks are welcome!

## Overview

This is a restaurant ordering chatbot developed using **Rasa** and **Python**. The bot is designed to guide users through the restaurant ordering process, from selecting items to confirming the order. However, it’s currently in a development phase with some known issues.

## Current Status

- **Functionality:** Basic ordering flow works, but there are bugs that need resolution.
- **Error Handling:** Some user inputs may cause unexpected behavior.
- **Incomplete Features:** Additional refinement and enhancements are planned, but I am currently unable to continue development due to time constraints.

## Future Plans

- Improve error handling and conversation flow.
- Add more ordering options and responses.
- Optimize the bot’s ability to handle various inputs and queries.
- Implement full integration with backend order processing (optional).
